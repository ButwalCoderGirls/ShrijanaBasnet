            <h3>Acid attacks:</h3>
            <p>
                An acid attack also called acid throwing, vitriol attack, or vitriolage, is a form of violent assault involving
                 the act of throwing acid or a similarly corrosive substance onto the body of another "with the 
                 intention to disfigure, maim, torture, or kill". Perpetrators of these attacks throw corrosive liquids 
                 at their victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing
                 and sometimes dissolving the bones. Acid attacks can often lead to permanent blindness
